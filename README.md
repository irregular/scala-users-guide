Scala User's Guide
==================

[Scala User's Guide](https://github.com/irregular/scala-users-guide) .

This is my attempt to learn [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) by
write a language guide heavily based on [Ruby User's Guide](http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/)
originally writen by Yukihiro Matsumoto, and translated by Goto Kentaro and Mark Slagell.
Back when I was learning Ruby this guide got me started and
I loved the way was structured, every section and every example
were super helpful.

It doesn't contains many or any idomatic solutions/examples. For me, that's the next step after reading this guide.
