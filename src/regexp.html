  <h3>Regexp</h3>

  <p>
    Let's put together a more interesting program.  This time we
    test whether a string fits a description, encoded into a concise
    <em>pattern</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some characters and character combinations that have
    special meaning in these patterns, including:
  </p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>[]</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        range specification (e.g., <code>[a-z]</code> means a letter in
        the range <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\w</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        word character; same as <code>[0-9A-Za-z_]</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\W</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        non-word character
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\s</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        space character; same as <code>[ \t\n\r\f]</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\S</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        non-space character
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\d</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        digit character; same as <code>[0-9]</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\D</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        non-digit character
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\b</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        backspace (0x08) (only if in a range specification)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\b</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        word boundary (if not in a range specification)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>\\B</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        non-word boundary
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>*</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        zero or more repetitions of the preceding
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>+</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        one or more repetitions of the preceding
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>{m,n}</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        at least m and at most n repetitions of the preceding
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>?</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        at most one repetition of the preceding; same as
      <code>{0,1}</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>|</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        either preceding or next expression may match
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>()</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        grouping
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    The common term for patterns that use this strange vocabulary is
    <em>regular expressions</em>.  In scala, as in Perl, they are generally
    surrounded by forward slashes rather than double quotes.  If you have
    never worked with regular expressions before, they probably look
    anything but <em>regular</em>, but you would be wise to spend some time
    getting familiar with them.  They have an efficient expressive power
    that will save you headaches (and many lines of code) whenever you
    need to do pattern matching, searching, or other manipulations on text
    strings.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, suppose we want to test whether a string fits this
    description: "Starts with lower case f, which is immediately followed
    by exactly one upper case letter, and optionally more junk after that,
    as long as there are no more lower case characters."  If you're an
    experienced C programmer, you've probably already written about a
    dozen lines of code in your head, right?  Admit it; you can hardly
    help yourself.  But in scala you need only request that your string be
    tested against the regular expression <code>/^f[A-Z][^a-z]*$/</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    How about "Contains a hexadecimal number enclosed in angle
    brackets"?  No problem.
  </p>

  <div class=shell>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> def chab(s:String): Boolean =&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; |<span class="repl">"&lt;0(x|X)([0-9]|[a-f]|[A-F])+&gt;".r.unanchored.pattern.matcher(s).matches</span>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> chab "Not this one."</span><br>
    <span class="repl-output">&nbsp; res: Boolean = false<br></span>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> chab "Maybe this? {0x35}"&nbsp; &nbsp; # wrong kind of brackets</span><br>
    <span class="repl-output">&nbsp; res: Boolean = false<br></span>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> chab "Or this? &lt;0x38z7e&gt;"&nbsp; &nbsp; # bogus hex digit</span><br>
    <span class="repl-output">&nbsp; res: Boolean = false<br></span>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> chab "Okay, this: &lt;0xfc0004&gt;."</span><br>
    <span class="repl-output">&nbsp; res: Boolean = true<br></span>
  </div>

  <p>
    Though regular expressions can be puzzling at first glance, you
    will quickly gain satisfaction in being able to express yourself so
    economically.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a little program to help you experiment with regular
    expressions. Store it as <code>regx.rb</code> and run it by
    typing <code>"scala regx.rb"</code> at the command line.
  </p>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">
    println("Enter an empty string at any time to exit.")

    var loop = true
    while( loop ){
      println( "str> " )

      var str = readLine()
      if( str.length == 0 )
        loop = false
      println( "pat> " )
      var pat = readLine()

      if( pat.length == 0 )
        loop = false
      if ( loop ){
        println(str.replaceAll("("+pat+")", "[$1]"))
      }
    }
  </script>

  <p>
    The program requires input twice, once for a string and once for a
    regular expression.  The string is tested against the regular
    expression, then displayed with all the matching parts highlighted in
    reverse video.  Don't mind details now; an analysis of this code
    will come soon.
  </p>
  <div class=shell>
    str&gt; foobar<br>
    pat&gt; ^fo+<br>
    [foo]bar<br>
  </div>

  <p>
    What you see above as red text will appear as reverse video in the
    program output.  The "~~~" lines are for the benefit of those using
    text-based browsers.
  </p>

  <p>Let's try several more inputs.</p>

  <div class=shell>
    str&gt; abc012dbcd555<br>
    pat&gt; \\d<br>
    abc[012]dbcd[555]<br>
  </div>

  <p>
    If that surprised you, refer to the table at the top of this page:
    <code>\d</code> has no relationship to the character <code>d</code>, but
    rather matches a single digit.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if there is more than one way to correctly match the pattern?
  </p>

  <div class=shell>
    str&gt; foozboozer<br>
    pat&gt; f.*z<br>
    [foozbooz]er<br>
  </div>

  <p>
    <code>foozbooz</code> is matched instead of just <code>fooz</code>, since a
    regular expression matches the longest possible substring.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a pattern to isolate a colon-delimited time field.
  </p>

  <div class=shell>
    str&gt; Wed Feb&nbsp; 7 08:58:04 JST 1996<br>
    pat&gt; [0-9]+:[0-9]+(:[0-9]+)?<br>
    Wed Feb&nbsp; 7 [08:58:04] JST 1996<br>
  </div>

  <p>
    "<code>=~</code>" is a matching operator with respect to regular
    expressions; it returns the position in a string where a match was
    found, or <code>nil</code> if the pattern did not match.
  </p>

  <div class=shell>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> "abcdef" =~ /d/</span><br>
    <span class="repl-output">&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</span><br>
    scala&gt;<span class="repl"> "aaaaaa" =~ /d/</span><br>
    <span class="repl-output">&nbsp;&nbsp; nil</span>
  </div>
