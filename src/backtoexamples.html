  <h3> Back to examples </h3>

  <p>Now let's take apart the code of some of our previous example
  programs.</p>
  <p>The following appeared in the <a href="examples.html">simple examples</a> chapter.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>def fact(n)<br>
  &nbsp; if n == 0<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>
  &nbsp; else<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; n * fact(n-1)<br>
  &nbsp; end<br>
  end<br>
  puts fact(ARGV[0].to_i)</div>

  <p>Because this is the first explanation, we examine each line
  individually.</p>
  <h3><a name="label-0" id="label-0">Factorials</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Factorials" -->
  <p><div class=rbscript>def fact(n)</div>

  <p>In the first line, <code>def</code> is a statement to define a function
  (or, more precisely, a <em>method</em>; we'll talk more about what a
  method is in a <a href="methods.html">later chapter</a>).  Here, it
  specifies that the function <code>fact</code> takes a single argument,
  referred to as <code>n</code>.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>if n == 0</div>

  <p>The <code>if</code> is for checking a condition. When the condition
  holds, the next bit of code is evaluated; otherwise whatever follows the
  <code>else</code> is evaluated.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>1</div>

  <p>The value of <code>if</code> is 1 if the condition holds.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>else</div>

  <p>If the condition does not hold, the code from here to <code>end</code> is
  evaluated.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>n * fact(n-1)</div>

  <p>If the condition is not satisfied, the value of <code>if</code> is
  the result of <code>n</code> times <code>fact(n-1)</code>.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>end</div>

  <p>The first <code>end</code> closes the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>end</div>

  <p>The second <code>end</code> closes the <code>def</code> statement.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>puts fact(ARGV[0].to_i)</div>

  <p>This invokes our <code>fact()</code> function using a value specified
  from the command line, and prints the result.</p>
  <p><code>ARGV</code> is an array which contains command line arguments.
  The members of <code>ARGV</code> are strings, so we must convert this into a
  integral number by <code>to_i</code>.  Ruby does not convert strings into
  integers automatically like perl does.</p>
  <p>What would happen if we fed this program a negative number? Do you see
  the problem? Can you fix it?</p>
  <h3><a name="label-1" id="label-1">Strings</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Strings" -->
  <p>Next we examine the puzzle program from the chapter
  on <a href="strings.html">strings</a>.  As this is somewhat longer,
  we number the lines for reference.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>01 words = ['foobar', 'baz', 'quux']<br>
  02 secret = words[rand(3)]<br>
  03<br>
  04 print "guess? "<br>
  05 while guess = STDIN.gets<br>
  06&nbsp;&nbsp; guess.chop!<br>
  07&nbsp;&nbsp; if guess == secret<br>
  08&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; puts "You win!"<br>
  09&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; break<br>
  10&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
  11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; puts "Sorry, you lose."<br>
  12&nbsp;&nbsp; end<br>
  13&nbsp;&nbsp; print "guess? "<br>
  14 end<br>
  15 puts "the word is ", secret, "."</div>

  <p>In this program, a new control structure, <code>while</code>, is used.  The
  code between <code>while</code> and its corresponding <code>end</code> will execute
  repeatedly as long as some specified condition remains true.  In this
  case, <code>guess=STDIN.gets</code> is both an active statement (collecting a
  line of user input and storing it as <code>guess</code>), and a condition (if
  there is no input, <code>guess</code>, which repesents the value of the whole
  <code>guess=STDIN.gets</code> expression, has a nil value, causing
  <code>while</code> to stop looping).</p>
  <p><code>STDIN</code> is the standard input object.  Usually,
  <code>guess=gets</code> does the same thing as <code>guess=STDIN.gets</code>.</p>
  <p><code>rand(3)</code> in line 2 returns a random number
  in the range 0 to 2.  This random number is used to extract one
  of the members of the array <code>words</code>.</p>
  <p>In line 5 we read one line from standard input by the method
  <code>STDIN.gets</code>.  If <em>EOF</em> (end of file) occurs
  while getting the line, <code>gets</code> returns
  <code>nil</code>.  So the code associated with this
  <code>while</code> will repeat until it sees <em>^D</em> (try
  <em>^Z</em> or <em>F6</em> under DOS/Windows), signifying the end of input.</p>
  <p><code>guess.chop!</code> in line 6 deletes the last character from
  <code>guess</code>; in this case it will always be a <em>newline</em> character,
  <code>gets</code> includes that character to reflect the user's <em>Return</em>
  keystroke, but we're not interested in it.</p>
  <p>In line 15 we print the secret word.  We have written this as a
  <code>puts</code> (<code>put s</code>tring) statement with two arguments, which
  are printed one after the other; but it would have been equally
  effective to do it with a single argument, writing <code>secret</code> as
  <code>#{secret}</code> to make it clear that it is a variable to be
  evaluated, not a literal word to be printed:</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>puts "the word is #{secret}."</div>

  <p>Many programmers feel this is a cleaner way to express output; it builds a
  single string and presents it as a single argument to <code>puts</code>.</p>
  <p>Also, we are by now used to the idea of using <code>puts</code> for standard
  script output, but this script uses <code>print</code> instead, in lines 4
  and 13.  They are not quite the same thing.  <code>print</code> outputs
  exactly what it is given; <code>puts</code> also ensures that the output line
  ends.  Using <code>print</code> in lines 4 and 13 leaves the cursor next to
  what was just printed, rather than moving it to the beginning of the
  next line.  This creates a recognizable prompt for user input.  In
  general, the four output calls below are equivalent:</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript># newline is implicitly added by puts if there isn't one already:<br>
  puts&nbsp; "Darwin's wife, Esmerelda, died in a fit of penguins."<br>
  <br>
  # newline must be explicitly given to the print command:<br>
  print "Darwin's wife, Esmerelda, died in a fit of penguins.\n"<br>
  <br>
  # you can concatenate output with +:<br>
  print 'Darwin's wife, Esmerelda, died in a fit of penguins.'+"\n"<br>
  <br>
  # or concatenate by supplying more than one string:<br>
  print 'Darwin's wife, Esmerelda, died in a fit of penguins.', "\n"</div>

  <p>One possible gotcha: sometimes a text window is programmed to buffer
  output for the sake of speed, collecting individual characters and
  displaying them only when it is given a newline character.  So if the
  guessing game script misbehaves by not showing the prompt lines until
  after the user supplies a guess, buffering is the likely culprit.  To
  make sure this doesn't happen, you can <code>flush</code> the output as soon
  as you have printed the prompt.  It tells the standard output device
  (an object named <code>STDOUT</code>), "don't wait; display what you have in
  your buffer right now."</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>04 print "guess? "; STDOUT.flush<br>
  &nbsp; ...<br>
  13 print "guess? "; STDOUT.flush</div>

  <p>And in fact, we were more careful with this in the next script.</p>
  <h3><a name="label-2" id="label-2">Regular expressions</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Regular expressions" -->
  <p>Finally we examine this program from the chapter on <a href="regexp.html">regular
  expressions</a>.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>01 st = "\033[7m"<br>
  02 en = "\033[m"<br>
  03<br>
  04 puts "Enter an empty string at any time to exit."<br>
  05<br>
  06 while true<br>
  07&nbsp;&nbsp; print "str&gt; "; STDOUT.flush; str=gets.chop<br>
  08&nbsp;&nbsp; break if str.empty?<br>
  09&nbsp;&nbsp; print "pat&gt; "; STDOUT.flush; pat=gets.chop<br>
  10&nbsp;&nbsp; break if pat.empty?<br>
  11&nbsp;&nbsp; re = Regexp.new(pat)<br>
  12&nbsp;&nbsp; puts str.gsub(re, "#{st}\\&amp;#{en}")<br>
  13 end</div>

  <p>In line 6, the condition for <code>while</code> is hardwired to <code>true</code>,
  so it forms what looks like an infinite loop.  However we put
  <code>break</code> statements in the 8th and 10th lines to escape the loop.
  These two <code>break</code>s are also an example of "<code>if</code> modifiers."
  An <code>if</code> modifier executes the statement on its left hand side if
  and only if the specified condition is satisfied.  This construction
  is unusual in that it operates logically from right to left, but it is
  provided because for many people it mimics a similar pattern in
  natural speech. It also has the advantage of brevity, as it needs no
  <code>end</code> statement to tell the interpreter how much of the following
  code is supposed to be conditional.  An <code>if</code> modifier is
  conventionally used in situations where a statement and condition
  are short enough to fit comfortably together on one script line.</p>
  <p>Note the difference in the user interface compared to the
  string-guessing script.  This one lets the user quit by hitting the
  <em>Return</em> key on an empty line.  We are testing for emptiness of
  the input string, not for its nonexistence.</p>
  <p>In lines 7 and 9 we have a "non-destructive" chop; again, we're
  getting rid of the unwanted newline character we always get from
  <code>gets</code>.  Add the exclamation point, and we have a "destructive"
  chop.  What's the difference?  In ruby, we conventionally attach
  '<code>!</code>' or '<code>?</code>' to the end of certain method names.  The
  exclamation point (<code>!</code>, sometimes pronounced aloud as "bang!")
  indicates something potentially destructive, that is to say, something
  that can change the value of what it touches.  <code>chop!</code> affects a
  string directly, but <code>chop</code> gives you a chopped copy without
  damaging the original.  Here is an illustration of the difference.</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> s1 = "forth"</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; "forth"<br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> s1.chop!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; # This changes s1.</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; "fort"<br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> s2 = s1.chop&nbsp;&nbsp; # This puts a changed copy in s2,</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; "for"<br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> s1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; # ... without disturbing s1.</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; "fort"</div>

  <p>You'll also sometimes see <code>chomp</code> and <code>chomp!</code> used.  These
  are more selective: the end of a string gets bit off <em>only if it
  happens to be a newline.</em> So for example, <code>"XYZ".chomp!</code> does
  nothing.  If you need a trick to remember the difference, think of a
  person or animal tasting something before deciding to take a bite, as
  opposed to an axe chopping indiscriminately.</p>
  <p>The other method naming convention appears in lines 8 and 10.  A
  question mark (<code>?</code>, sometimes pronounced aloud as "huh?")
  indicates a "predicate" method, one that can return either <code>true</code>
  or <code>false</code>.</p>
  <p>Line 11 creates a regular expression object out of the string supplied
  by the user.  The real work is finally done in line 12, which uses
  <code>gsub</code> to <code>g</code>lobally <code>sub</code>stitute each match of that
  expression with itself, but surrounded by ansi markups; also the same
  line outputs the results.</p>
  <p>We could have broken up line 12 into separate lines like this:</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>highlighted = str.gsub(re,"#{st}\\&amp;#{en}")<br>
  puts highlighted</div>

  <p>or in "destructive" style:</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>str.gsub!(re,"#{st}\\&amp;#{en}")<br>
  puts str</div>

  <p>Look again at the last part of line 12.  <code>st</code> and <code>en</code> were
  defined in lines 1-2 as the ANSI sequences that make text
  color-inverted and normal, respectively.  In line 12 they are enclosed
  in <code>#{}</code> to ensure that they are actually interpreted as such (and
  we do not see the variable <em>names</em> printed instead).  Between
  these we see <code>\\&amp;</code>.  This is a little tricky.  Since the
  replacement string is in double quotes, the pair of backslashes will
  be interpreted as a single backslash; what <code>gsub</code> actually sees
  will be <code>\&amp;</code>, and that happens to be a special code that refers to
  whatever matched the pattern in the first place.  So the new string,
  when displayed, looks just like the old one, except that the parts
  that matched the given pattern are highlighted in inverse video.</p>
