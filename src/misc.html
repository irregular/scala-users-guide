  <h3>Misc</h3>

  <p>This chapter addresses a few practical issues.</p>
  <h3><a name="label-0" id="label-0">Statement delimiters</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Statement delimiters" -->
  <p>Some languages require some kind of punctuation, often a semicolon
  (<code>;</code>), to end each statement in a program.  Ruby
  instead follows the convention used in shells like <code>sh</code> and
  <code>csh</code>.  Multiple statements on one line must be
  separated by semicolons, but they are not required at the end of a
  line; a linefeed is treated like a semicolon.  If a line ends
  with a backslash (<code>\</code>), the linefeed following it is
  ignored; this allows you to have a single logical line that spans
  several lines.</p>
  <h3><a name="label-1" id="label-1">Comments</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Comments" -->
  <p>Why write comments?  Although well written code tends to be
  self-documenting, it is often helpful to scribble in the margins, and
  it can be a mistake to believe that others will be able to look at
  your code and immediately see it the way you do. Besides, for
  practical purposes, you yourself are a different person within a few
  days anyway; which of us hasn't gone back to fix or enhance a program
  after the passage of time and said, I know I wrote this, but what in
  blazes does it mean?</p>
  <p>Some experienced programmers will point out, quite correctly, that
  contradictory or outdated comments can be worse than none at all.
  Certainly, comments shouldn't be a substitute for readable code; if
  your code is unclear, it's probably also buggy.  You may find that you
  need to comment more while you are learning ruby, and then less as you
  become better at expressing your ideas in simple, elegant, readable
  code.</p>
  <p>Ruby follows a common scripting convention, which is to use a pound
  symbol (<code>#</code>) to denote the start of a comment.  Anything
  following an unquoted <code>#</code>, to the end of the line on which it
  appears, is ignored by the interpreter.</p>
  <p>Also, to facilitate large comment blocks, the ruby interpreter also
  ignores anything between a line starting with "<code>=begin</code>" and
  another line starting with "<code>=end</code>".</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>#!/usr/bin/env ruby<br>
  <br>
  =begin<br>
  **********************************************************************<br>
  &nbsp; This is a comment block, something you write for the benefit of<br>
  &nbsp; human readers (including yourself).&nbsp; The interpreter ignores it.<br>
  &nbsp; There is no need for a '#' at the start of every line.<br>
  **********************************************************************<br>
  =end</div>

  <h3><a name="label-2" id="label-2">Organizing your code</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Organizing your code" -->
  <p>Ruby's unusually high level of dynamism means that classes, modules,
  and methods exist only after their defining code runs.  If you're used
  to programming in a more static language, this can sometimes lead to
  surprises.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript># The below results in an "undefined method" error:<br>
  <br>
  puts successor(3)<br>
  <br>
  def successor(x)<br>
  &nbsp; x + 1<br>
  end</div>

  <p>Although the interpreter checks over the entire script file for
  syntax before executing it, the <code>def successor ... end</code> code
  has to actually run in order to create the <code>successor</code> method.
  So the order in which you arrange a script can matter.</p>
  <p>This does not, as it might seem at first glance, force you to
  organize your code in a strictly bottom-up fashion.  When the
  interpreter encounters a method definition, it can safely include
  undefined references, as long as you can be sure they will be defined
  by the time the method is actually invoked:</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript># Conversion of fahrenheit to celsius, broken<br>
  # down into two steps.<br>
  <br>
  def f_to_c(f)<br>
  &nbsp; scale(f - 32.0)&nbsp; # This is a forward reference, but it's okay.<br>
  end<br>
  <br>
  def scale(x)<br>
  &nbsp; x * 5.0 / 9.0<br>
  end<br>
  <br>
  printf "%.1f is a comfortable temperature.\n", f_to_c(72.3)</div>

  <p>So while this may seem less convenient than what you may be used to
  in Perl or Java, it is less restrictive than trying to write C without
  prototypes (which would require you to always maintain a partial
  ordering of what references what).  Putting top-level code at the
  bottom of a source file always works.  And even this is less of an
  annoyance than it might at first seem.  A sensible and painless way to
  enforce the behavior you want is to define a <code>main</code> function at
  the top of the file, and call it from the bottom.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>#!/usr/bin/env ruby<br>
  <br>
  def main<br>
  &nbsp; # Express the top level logic here...<br>
  end<br>
  <br>
  # ... put support code here, organized as you see fit ...<br>
  <br>
  main # ... and start execution here.</div>

  <p>It also helps that ruby provides tools for breaking complicated
  programs into readable, reusable, logically related chunks.  We have
  already seen the use of <code>include</code> for accessing modules.  You
  will also find the <code>load</code> and <code>require</code> facilities useful.
  <code>load</code> works as if the file it refers to were copied and pasted
  in (something like the <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive in
  C). <code>require</code> is somewhat more sophisticated, causing code
  to be loaded at most once and only when needed.</p>
  <h3><a name="label-3" id="label-3">That's it...</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "That's it..." -->
  <p>This tutorial should be enough to get you started writing programs in
  Ruby.  As further questions arise, you can get more help from the user
  community, and from an always-growing body of printed and online
  resources.</p>
  <p>Good luck, and happy coding!</p>
