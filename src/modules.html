  <h3>Modules</h3>

  <p>Modules in ruby are similar to classes, except:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A module can have no instances.</li>
  <li>A module can have no subclasses.</li>
  <li>A module is defined by <code>module ... end</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Actually... the Module class of module is the superclass of the
  Class class of class.  Got that? No? Let's move
  on. </p>
  <p>There are two typical uses of modules.  One is to collect
  related methods and constants in a central location.  The
  <code>Math</code> module in ruby's standard library plays such a
  role:</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> Math.sqrt(2)</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.41421</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> Math::PI</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.14159</b></font></div>

  <p>The <code>::</code> operator tells the ruby interpreter which module it
  should consult for the value of a constant (conceivably, some module
  besides <code>Math</code> might mean something else by <code>PI</code>).
  If we want to refer to the methods or constants of a module directly
  without using <code>::</code>, we can <code>include</code> that module:</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> include Math</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Object</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> sqrt(2)</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.41421</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> PI</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.14159</b></font></div>

  <p>Another use of modules is called <em>mixin</em>.  Some OO
  programming languages, including C++, allow <em>multiple
  inheritance</em>, that is, inheritance from more than one
  superclass.  A real-world example of multiple inheritance is an
  alarm clock; you can think of alarm clocks as belonging to the class
  of <em>clocks</em> and also the class of <em>things with
  buzzers</em>.</p>
  <p>Ruby purposely does not implement true multiple inheritance, but
  the <em>mixin</em> technique is a good alternative.  Remember that
  modules cannot be instantiated or subclassed; but if we
  <code>include</code> a module in a class definition, its methods are
  effectively appended, or "mixed in", to the class.</p>
  <p>Mixin can be thought of as a way of asking for whatever particular
  properties we want to have.  For example, if a class has a
  working <code>each</code> method, mixing in the standard library's
  <code>Enumerable</code> module gives us <code>sort</code> and
  <code>find</code> methods for free.</p>
  <p>This use of modules gives us the basic functionality of multiple
  inheritance but allows us to represent class relationships with a
  simple tree structure, and so simplifies the language implementation
  considerably (a similar choice was made by the designers of Java).</p>
