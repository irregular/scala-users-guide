  <h3>Object oriented</h3>

  <p><em>Object oriented</em> is a catchy phrase.  To call anything
  object oriented can make you sound pretty smart.  Ruby claims to be
  an object oriented scripting language; but what exactly does "object
  oriented" mean?</p>
  <p>There have been a variety of answers to that question, all of which
  probably boil down to about the same thing.  Rather than sum it
  too quickly, let's think for a moment about the traditional
  programming paradigm.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, a programming problem is attacked by coming up with
  some kinds of <em>data representations</em>, and <em>procedures</em>
  that operate on that data.  Under this model, data is inert,
  passive, and helpless; it sits at the complete mercy of a large
  procedural body, which is active, logical, and all-powerful.</p>
  <p>The problem with this approach is that programs are written by
  programmers, who are only human and can only keep so much detail clear
  in their heads at any one time.  As a project gets larger, its
  procedural core grows to the point where it is difficult to remember
  how the whole thing works.  Minor lapses of thinking and
  typographical errors become more likely to result in well-concealed
  bugs.  Complex and unintended interactions begin to emerge within
  the procedural core, and maintaining it becomes like trying to carry
  around an angry squid without letting any tentacles touch your
  face.  There are guidelines for programming that can help to
  minimize and localize bugs within this traditional paradigm, but there
  is a better solution that involves fundamentally changing the way we
  work.</p>
  <p>What object-oriented programming does is to let us delegate most of
  the mundane and repetitive logical work <em>to the data itself</em>;
  it changes our concept of data from <em>passive</em> to
  <em>active</em>.  Put another way,</p>
  <ul>
  <li>We stop treating each piece of data as a box with an open lid
     that lets us reach in and throw things around.</li>
  <li>We start treating each piece of data as a working machine with a
     closed lid and a few well-marked switches and dials.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What is described above as a "machine" may be very simple or
  complex on the inside; we can't tell from the outside, and we don't
  allow ourselves to open the machine up (except when we are absolutely
  sure something is wrong with its design), so we are required to do
  things like flip the switches and read the dials to interact with the
  data.  Once the machine is built, we don't want to have to
  think about how it operates.</p>
  <p>You might think we are just making more work for ourselves, but
  this approach tends to do a nice job of preventing all kinds of things
  from going wrong.</p>
  <p>Let's start with a example that is too simple to be of practical
  value, but should illustrate at least part of the concept.  Your
  car has a tripmeter.  Its job is to keep track of the distance
  the car has travelled since the last time its reset button was
  pushed.  How would we model this in a programming language?
  In C, the tripmeter would just be a numeric variable, possibly of type
  <code>float</code>.  The program would manipulate that variable
  by increasing its value in small increments, with occasional resets to
  zero when appropriate.  What's wrong with that? A bug in
  the program could assign a bogus value to the variable, for any number
  of unexpected reasons.  Anyone who has programmed in C knows what
  it is like to spend hours or days tracking down such a bug whose cause
  seems absurdly simple once it has been found.  (The moment of
  finding the bug is commonly indicated by the sound of a loud slap to
  the forehead.)</p>
  <p>The same problem would be attacked from a much different angle in
  an object-oriented context.  The first thing a programmer asks
  when designing the tripmeter is not "which of the familiar data types
  comes closest to resembling this thing?" but "how exactly is this
  thing supposed to act?" The difference winds up being a profound
  one.  It is necessary to spend a little bit of time deciding
  exactly what an odometer is for, and how the outside world expects to
  interact with it.  We decide to build a little machine with
  controls that allow us to increment it, reset it, read its value, and
  nothing else.</p>
  <p>We don't provide a way for a tripmeter to be assigned arbitrary
  values; why? because we all know tripmeters don't work that way.
  There are only a few things you should be able to do with a tripmeter,
  and those are all we allow.  Thus, if something else in the
  program mistakenly tries to place some other value (say, the target
  temperature of the vehicle's climate control) into the tripmeter,
  there is an immediate indication of what went wrong.  We are told
  when running the program (or possibly while compiling, depending on
  the nature of the language) that <em>we are not allowed to assign
  arbitrary values to Tripmeter objects</em>.  The message might
  not be exactly that clear, but it will be reasonably close to
  that.  It doesn't prevent the error, does it? But it
  quickly points us in the direction of the cause.  This is only
  one of several ways in which OO programming can save a lot of wasted
  time.</p>
  <p>We commonly take one step of abstraction above this, because it
  turns out to be as easy to build a factory that makes machines as it
  is to make an individual machine.  We aren't likely to build a
  single tripmeter directly; rather, we arrange for any number of
  tripmeters to be built from a single pattern.  The pattern (or if
  you like, the tripmeter factory) corresponds to what we call a
  <em>class</em>, and an individual tripmeter generated from the pattern
  (or made by the factory) corresponds to an <em>object</em>.  Most
  OO languages require a class to be defined before we can have a new
  kind of object, but ruby does not.</p>
  <p>It's worth noting here that the use of an OO language will not
  <em>enforce</em> proper OO design.  Indeed it is possible in any
  language to write code that is unclear, sloppy, ill-conceived, buggy,
  and wobbly all over.  What ruby does for you (as opposed,
  especially, to C++) is to make the practice of OO programming feel
  natural enough that even when you are working on a small scale you
  don't feel a necessity to resort to ugly code to save effort.  We
  will be discussing the ways in which ruby accomplishes that admirable
  goal as this guide progresses; the next topic will be the "switches
  and dials" (object methods) and from there we'll move on to the
  "factories" (classes).  Are you still with us?</p>
