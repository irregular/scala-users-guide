  <h3>Ensure</h3>

  <p>There may be cleanup work that is necessary when a method finishes
  its work.  Perhaps an open file should be closed, buffered data
  should be flushed, etc.  If there were always only one exit point
  for each method, we could confidently put our cleanup code in one
  place and know that it would be executed; however, a method might
  return from several places, or our intended cleanup code might be
  unexpectedly skipped because of an exception.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>file = open("/tmp/some_file", "w")<br>
  begin<br>
  &nbsp; # ... write to the file ...<br>
  &nbsp; file.close<br>
  end</div>

  <p>In the above, if an exception occurred during the section of code
  where we were writing to the file, the file would be left open.
  And we don't want to resort to this kind of redundancy:</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>file = open("/tmp/some_file", "w")<br>
  begin<br>
  &nbsp; # ... write to the file ...<br>
  &nbsp; file.close<br>
  rescue<br>
  &nbsp; file.close<br>
  &nbsp; fail # raise an exception<br>
  end</div>

  <p>It's clumsy, and gets out of hand when the code gets more
  complicated because we have to deal with every <code>return</code> and
  <code>break</code>.</p>
  <p>For this reason we add another keyword to the
  "<code>begin...rescue...end</code>" scheme, which is
  <code>ensure</code>.  The <code>ensure</code> code block executes
  regardless of the success or failure of the <code>begin</code> block.</p>
  <p><div class=rbscript>file = open("/tmp/some_file", "w")<br>
  begin<br>
  &nbsp; # ... write to the file ...<br>
  rescue<br>
  &nbsp; # ... handle the exceptions ...<br>
  ensure<br>
  &nbsp; file.close&nbsp;&nbsp; # ... and this always happens.<br>
  end</div>

  <p>It is possible to use <code>ensure</code> without
  <code>rescue</code>, or vice versa, but if they are used together in
  the same<code> begin...end </code>block, the <code>rescue</code> must
  precede the <code>ensure</code>.</p>
