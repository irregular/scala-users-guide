  <h3> Access Control </h3>

  <p>Earlier, we said that ruby has no functions, only methods.
  However there is more than one kind of method.  In this chapter
  we introduce <em>access controls</em>.</p>
  <p>Consider what happens when we define a method in the "top level",
  not inside a class definition.  We can think of such a method as
  analogous to a <em>function</em> in a more traditional language like C.</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> def square(n)</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; n * n</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b> end</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; nil</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> square(5)</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 25</b></font></div>

  <p>Our new method would appear not to belong to any class, but in fact
  ruby gives it to the <code>Object</code> class, which is a superclass
  of every other class.  As a result, any object should now be able
  to use that method.  That turns out to be true, but there's a
  small catch: it is a <em>private</em> method of every class.
  We'll discuss some of what this means below, but one consequence is
  that it may be invoked only in function style, as here:</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> class Foo</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; def fourth_power_of(x)</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; square(x) * square(x)</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; end</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b> end</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; nil<br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> Foo.new.fourth_power_of 10</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; 10000</div>

  <p>We are not allowed to explicitly apply the method to an object:</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> "fish".square(5)</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>ERR: (eval):1: private method `square' called for "fish":String</b></font></div>

  <p>This rather cleverly preserves ruby's pure-OO nature (functions are
  still object methods, but the receiver is <code>self</code>
  implicitly) while providing functions that can be written just as in a
  more traditional language.</p>
  <p>A common mental discipline in OO programming, which we have hinted
  at in an earlier chapter, concerns the separation of
  <em>specification</em> and <em>implementation</em>, or <em>what</em> tasks an
  object is supposed to accomplish and <em>how</em> it actually
  accomplishes them.  The internal workings of an object should be
  kept generally hidden from its users; they should only care about what
  goes in and what comes out, and trust the object to know what it is
  doing internally.  As such it is often helpful for classes to
  have methods that the outside world does not see, but which are used
  internally (and can be improved by the programmer whenever desired,
  without changing the way users see objects of that class).  In
  the trivial example below, think of <code>engine</code> as the invisible
  inner workings of the class.</p>
  <p><div class=shell>ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> class Test</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; def times_two(a)</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; puts "#{a} times two is #{engine(a)}"</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; end</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; def engine(b)</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; b*2</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; end</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; private:engine&nbsp; # this hides engine from users</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; |<font color="#ffff00"><b> end</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Test</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> test = Test.new</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; #&lt;Test:0x4017181c&gt;</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> test.engine(6)</b></font><br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>ERR: (eval):1: private method `engine' called for #&lt;Test:0x4017181c&gt;</b></font><br>
  ruby&gt;<font color="#ffff00"><b> test.times_two(6)</b></font><br>
  6 times two is 12.<br>
  <font color="#50ffff"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; nil</b></font></div>

  <p>We might have expected <code>test.engine(6)</code> to return 12, but
  instead we learn that <code>engine</code> is inaccessible when we
  are acting as a user of a <code>Test</code> object.  Only other
  <code>Test</code> methods, such as <code>times_two</code>, are allowed to
  use <code>engine</code>.  We are required to go through the
  public interface, which consists of the <code>times_two</code>
  method.  The programmer who is in charge of this class can change
  <code>engine</code> freely (here, perhaps by changing <code>b*2</code>
  to <code>b+b</code>, assuming for the sake of argument that it improved
  performance) without affecting how the user interacts with
  <code>Test</code> objects.  This example is of course much too simple
  to be useful; the benefits of access controls become more clear only
  when we begin to create more complicated and interesting classes.</p>
